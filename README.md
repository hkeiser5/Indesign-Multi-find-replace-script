# Indesign-Multi-find-replace-script
Script that can do a multi find and replace with grep styles from a csv sheet

Script opens a file opend dialog that asks for a csv, then looks for two headers, "find" and "replace", then searches the open document for every find value and replaces it with grep formatting with every corrosponding replace value.

Make sure there are no empty fields within the find or replace columns. Otherwise it will throw an error.
